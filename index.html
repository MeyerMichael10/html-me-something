            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Have you been huddled in your house all winter, hiding from the frigid hellscape that
                is Missouri in the winter? If not, do you now dread the prospect of going outside to
                brave the meteorological shit circus we call the midwest? Well fret 
                not, because the end is in sight. Slowly but surely the days are getting longer, the 
                air is getting warmer, and nature is waking up like you would after passing out at the
                end of a 36 hour bender: slowly, and accompanied by wild mood swings. Indeed, Spring is
                upon us. So now the universal problem for people is figuring out some dope shit to do.
                Do you know what the dopest shit ever is? Nature. The earth is covered in it, albeit
                maybe not as much as it used to be. As a reward for putting up with its bullshit for
                the last 4 months or so, nature gives us a place to do all kinds of activities.
                "But Mike," you say, "what the shit am I supposed to do in nature?". The real answer
                is: pretty much whatever the fuck you want. But in case you need some ideas, I've made
                a list of some cool shit you can do outside right here in the midwest.

        <div id="hiking">
            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            <p>Ah, hiking. For our ancestors, hiking was just something you had to do to get 
                places. In the 21st century, hiking is a fun way to see some sights, get some
                excercise, and just generally enjoy the great outdoors. Hiking has something to
                offer for everyone, and can be as simple and accessible as a nice stroll through
                forest or as exciting and challenging as climbing a mountain. Don't feel like going
                out and buying a bunch of fancy gear? Don't worry! There are a plenty of trails that
                require nothing more than a comfy pair of shoes and some water, so anyone can get out
                on the trail and start enjoying nature. Not sure where to start? 
                Take a look at <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/us/missouri" target="_blank">Alltrails.com</a>
                to find trails near you, as well as directions to get there, reviews and information from other
                people who have hiked there, and information about the other activities you can engage in around
                the area.

        <div id="trail running">
            <h3>Trail Running</h3>
            <p>Are you one of those weirdos who runs for fun? Do you like the idea of hiking a trail,
                but hate all that "walking" and "taking your time" business? Then look no further than
                trail running! In case you couldn't figure it out based on the name, trail running is just
                that: running on a trail. Just like with hiking, you can check out <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/us/missouri" target="_blank">Alltrails.com</a>
                to get started finding a trail near you, and after that all you have to do is lace up your shoes,
                grab your water bottle, and hit the trail. With an even lower barrier of entry than hiking, and the ability
                to do it pretty much anywhere you would go hiking, trail running is an easily accessible option
                for those who enjoy running and want more excitement out of their nature experience.
            </p>

        <div id="cycling">
            <h3>Cycling</h3>
            <p>If trail running can't fulfill your need for speed, perhaps cycling might be more your speed.
                While cycling requires more gear than hiking or trail running, namely a bicycle and a helmet,
                it can scratch a similar itch. Cycling differs from the other two in that you dont even really
                need a trail to enjoy it; you can always just get out there and start pedalling! But the real fun
                begins when you hit the trail. This form of cycling is often called mountain biking. Like trail running,
                the idea of mountain biking is to get through the trail as fast as possible, but mountain biking allows
                for higher speeds and requires careful bike control, creating a more intense and engaging experience.
                Dedicated mountain bike trail also tend to be more interesting than hiking trails, incorporating jumps,
                hard banking turns, and other feature meant to provide more of a challenge to the rider.
                There are a number of dedicated mountain bike trails in Missouri, but many regular
                hiking trails also allow cyclists, so long as they can be courteous to the other people enjoying the trail.
                If you're looking for a trail to get out and shred, <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/us/missouri" target="_blank">Alltrails.com</a>
                has a wide variety of trails for every skill level, and all of the previously mentioned information to help
                you find the best trail for you.

        <div id="swimming">
            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <p>How much really needs to be said about swimming? It's classic summertime activity, and it's easy to see why.
                Swimming provides a fun and easy way to beat the heat, and is an excellent form of excercise for your whole 
                body. Public pools are common and accessible in many places, but you don't need a pool to enjoy a day in the
                water. Missouri is chock full of lakes and rivers that make excellent swimming holes, and enjoying nature is
                really the whole point of all of this, anyway. Regular ol' swimming not doing it for you? Snorkeling and SCUBA
                diving are also possible at some places in Missouri, allowing you to explore the parts of nature that you wouldn't
                normally get to see. To find a place to make a splash, the Missouri State Parks website has a <a href="https://mostateparks.com/activity/swimming" target="_blank">list of parks that have places to swim</a>,
                including swimming pools, rivers, and lakes.

        <div id="fishing">
            <h3>Fishing</h3>
            <p>Fishing is another summertime classic. Fishing is an excellent choice of outdoor activity,
                because it can be as relaxing or exhilarating as you'd like. Few things are as peaceful as a nice calm day out on the lake,
                casting lines and spending time with your friends, and few experiences can compare to the rush
                of fighting hard to land that big fish, and the subsequent feeling of success at having pulled it up.
                Whether you're sitting in a boat in the middle of the lake, or sitting on the edge of the river, fishing
                is a great way to spend a sunny day. If you dont already have a favorite spot, check the <a href="https://mostateparks.com/activity/fishing" target="_blank">Missouri State Parks</a>
                website to see if fishing is allowed at a park near you. Then all you have to do is get out there and have fun!

        <div id="floating">
            <h3>Floating</h3>
            <p>Do you love swimming and hiking, but hate the part where you have to exert yourself?
                do you long to spend a weekend getting absolutely hammered while you float leisurely down a
                river? Then floating would be the perfect activity for you! Combining the serene views of nature with
                the relaxation of kicking back with your friends and some beers, floating is the ultimate activity
                for those who just want to enjoy the moment, carried along by the flow of the river. Grab yourself
                a raft, inner tube, canoe, kayak, or any flotation device that strikes your fancy and bring a few friends.
                Don't have any of those things? That's cool too! There are a number of places near popular floating
                spots that rent canoes,tubes, and sometimes other options, as well as usually providing your group
                with a lift back to where you started, because you definitely shouldn't be driving after that many
                PBRs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="camping">
            <h3>Camping</h3>
            <p>Camping: the king of all outdoor activities. Camping is one of the most popular nature
                activities, and it's easy to see why. A camping trip lets you get away from the hustle and
                bustle of daily life, taking you back to a simpler time without all of the bright lights and
                loud noises of modern civilization. It can be as primitive as you like, from just a tent in the woods
                and some basic necessities for survival all the way up to fancy tents and gear or even campers, allowing
                you to have the camping experience without even thinking about roughing it.
                Camping is truly an activity for everyone, and often goes hand-in-hand with many of the other activities on this list.
                To find a park near you, head back over to the <a href="https://mostateparks.com/activity/camping" target="_blank">Missouri State Parks</a>
                website and start planning your trip!
